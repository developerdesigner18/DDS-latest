                E-commerce is the process of purchasing and selling products or
                services online, as well as the data and money transfers
                required to execute the transactions. It is often referred to as
                online commerce or electronic commerce. E-commerce, often known
                as electronic commerce, is the exchange of products and services
                as well as the sending of money and data through an electronic
                network, most commonly the internet. These commercial dealings
                can be either B2B (business-to-business), B2C
                (business-to-consumer), C2C (consumer-to-consumer), or C2B.
                Reaching as many clients as possible at the correct moment will
                enhance sales and the profitability of the company. E-commerce
                involves the purchasing and selling of items as well as sending
                money or data through the internet.

                A business-to-business (B2B) transaction, usually referred to as
                a B-to-B transaction, is a type of transaction between
                businesses. Examples include a transaction between a
                manufacturer and wholesaler or a wholesaler and a retailer.
                Business-to-firm refers to transactions that take place between
                businesses rather than between a business and a specific
                customer. Contrasting with business-to-consumer (B2C) and
                business-to-government (B2G) transactions are
                business-to-business transactions. In a normal supply chain,
                transactions between businesses are frequent as companies buy
                parts and goods, like other raw materials, to utilise in
                production. After that, finished goods can be bought and sold
                between businesses and individuals. Planning is necessary for
                business-to-business transactions to go well. Such transactions
                depend on the account management staff of a firm to develop
                customer connections. For effective transactions to occur,
                business-to-business relationships must also be fostered,
                generally through professional meetings prior to sales.

                A non-profit organisation is a group that was established with
                the intention of making a profit, and in which no part of the
                organisation's revenue is given to its directors, officials, or
                members. The public is served by nonprofit organisations, which
                offer a variety of services to raise the standard of living for
                individuals or communities. They frequently have a large
                contingent of volunteers or temporary employees with a variety
                of skill sets and strong altruistic motivations. A non-profit
                organisation's owners do not receive any income from it. Instead
                of using the money it gets for its own purposes, the group
                contributes it. Donations received may also be used by a
                not-for-profit organisation to maintain operations.

                A startup is a business in its infancy that is founded by one or
                more persons with the intention of disrupting an established
                market with special goods or services. Startup businesses
                frequently struggle with a lack of funding for their operations,
                making them unable to compete with more established businesses.
                A tech startup is a business whose goal is to market
                technology-related goods or services. These businesses offer
                brand-new technological goods or services, as well as innovative
                ways to offer already-available technological goods or services.
                Startups are often run by one or a small group of entrepreneurs
                who are eager to fill a market gap with a fresh product or
                service. A startup firm is concerned with rapid and lucrative
                expansion within its target market, while small enterprises
                frequently have the objective of staying small.

                Real estate, often known as real property, is made up of both
                land and improvements, such as buildings, fixtures, roads,
                buildings, and utility systems. Natural resources including
                minerals, plants, animals, water, and improvements are given a
                title of ownership through property rights. Real estate is among
                the top investment possibilities because of its minimal risk and
                high potential return. As property prices increase over time, it
                acts as an inflation safety net. In addition to owning a
                permanent abode, income generation is among the most crucial
                factors for horizontal property investors.

                To maintain contact with friends, family, or classmates, social
                networking involves using internet-based social media platforms.
                Social networking is used by marketers to build brand awareness
                and foster customer loyalty. Social media may link individuals
                and organisations, as well as serve to spread brand awareness.
                The term "social networking" describes the co-mingling of people
                and organisations over a medium in order to exchange ideas,
                interests, and activities. There are several web-based social
                network services, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
                Google+, and others. People can engage through social media in
                ways we never would have thought possible, unlike how we have up
                until now. A quick message on a computer, phone, or even email
                might be used to catch up on someone's life. With the use of
                social media, one may communicate in both their personal and
                professional lives.

                Social networking platforms may give users an easy-to-use and
                effective arsenal for publicising and pursuing causes and
                concerns that concern and influence young people. To highlight
                concerns and ideas and draw attention from a larger audience,
                social networking platforms can be used to organise activities,
                events, or organisations.
